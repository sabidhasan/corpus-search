Those are the ones whose hearts Allâh does not want to purify (from disbelief and hypocrisy); for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment.",

They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it, but if you are not given, then beware.” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided, there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment."

He said, \"I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?\" the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"Jibrael (Gabriel) has just now informed me of that.\" Ibn Salâm said, \"He [i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel)] is the enemy of the Jews from amongst the angels.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"As for the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect (or gather) the people from the east to the west. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man’s discharge precedes the woman’s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman’s discharge precedes the man’s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman.\" On this, ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm said, \"I testify that Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and that you are the Messenger of Allâh\", and added, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Jews make such lies as make one astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to Islâm.\"\nThe Jews came and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"What kind of man is ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm among you?\" They replied, \"The best of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"What would you think if ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm should embrace Islâm?\" They said, \"May Allâh protect him from that.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم repeated his question and they gave the same answer, then ‘Abdullâh came out to them and said. \"I testify that Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the Messenger of Allâh!\" On this, the Jews said, \"He is the most wicked among us and the son of the most wicked among us.\" So they degraded him.

The tale of a leper, a bald man and a blind man:\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه that he heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, \"Allâh willed to test three Isrâelis who were a leper, a blind man and a bald headed man. So, He sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, ‘What thing do you like most?’ He replied, ‘Good colour and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.’ The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good colour and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied, ‘Camels.’\nSo he (i.e., the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), ‘May Allâh bless you in it.’ The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, ‘What thing do you like most?’ He said, ‘I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.’ The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied ‘Cows.’ The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, ‘May Allâh bless in it.’ The angel went to the blind man and asked, ‘What thing do you like best?’ He said, ‘(I like) that Allâh may restore my eyesight to me so that I may see the people.’ The angel touched his eyes and Allâh gave him back his eyesight. The angel asked him, ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied, ‘Sheep.’ The angel gave him a pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, ‘I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allâh and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice colour and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.’ The man replied, ‘I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).’ The angel said, ‘I think I know you. Were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren’t you a poor man, and then Allâh gave you (all this property).’ He replied, ‘(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my forefathers.’ The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie, then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, ‘I am a poor man and a traveller, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allâh, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eyesight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.’ The man said, ‘No doubt, I was blind and Allâh gave me back my eyesight; I was poor and Allâh made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allâh, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allâh’s sake.’ The angel replied, ‘Keep your property with you. You (i.e., three men) have been tested and Allâh is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions.’\" (Sahih Al Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.670).",
