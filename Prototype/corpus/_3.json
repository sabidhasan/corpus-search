While he was offering prayer, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), \"Shall I answer her or keep on praying?\" (He went on praying and did not answer her). His mother said, \"O Allâh! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.\" So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said: \"O child! Who is your father?\" The child replied, \"The shepherd\" (after hearing this) the people said, \"We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,\" but he said: \"No, of nothing but mud.\" (The third was the hero of the following story): A lady from Banî Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, \"O Allâh! Make my child like him.\" On that the child left her breast and facing the rider said: \"O Allâh! Do not make me like him.\" The child then started to suck her breast again. [Abu Hurairah further said, \"As if I were now looking at the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.\")]. After a while they (some people) passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child’s mother) said, \"O Allâh! Do not make my child like this (slave-girl)!\" On that the child left her breast, and said, \"O Allâh! Make me like her.\" When she asked why, the child replied, \"The rider is one of the tyrants while this slave-girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual intercourse.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.645).",

While I was in Shâm, a letter sent by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, ‘Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a Prophet?’ The people replied, ‘Yes,’ so, along with some other Quraishi men, I was called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, ‘Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a Prophet?’ I (Abu Sufyân) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). ‘Tell them (i.e. Abu Sufyân’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyân) regarding that man who claims to be a Prophet. So, if he tells me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).’ By Allâh, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, ‘Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet’s) family status amongst you?’ I said, ‘He belongs to a noble family amongst us.’ Heraclius said, ‘Was any of his ancestors a king?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?’ I said, ‘It is the poor who follow him.’ He said, ‘Is the number of his followers increasing or decreasing?’ I said, ‘They are increasing.’ He said, ‘Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Did you fight with him?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘How was your fighting with him?’ I said, ‘The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us in turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.’ He said, ‘Did he ever betray?’ I said, ‘No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it.’ \" Abu Sufyân added, \"By Allâh, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, ‘Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claim the same (i.e. to be Allâh’s Prophet) before him?’ I said, ‘No’. Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyân), ‘I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you. Verily, all Messengers come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his forefathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his forefathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Messengers. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could never tell a lie about Allâh. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is faith when its delight enters the heart and mixes with it completely. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were increasing, that is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casualties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Messengers, they are put to trials and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he has ever betrayed anyone; you claimed that he had never betrayed. Indeed, Messengers never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.’ Abu Sufyân said, \"Heraclius then asked me, ‘What does he order you to do?’ I said, ‘He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakât, and to keep good relationship with the kith and kin, and to be chaste.’ Then Heraclius said, ‘If whatever you have said is true, then he is really a Prophet. I knew that he (i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely) to what is under my feet.’ Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allâh’s. Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and read it, wherein was written: In the Name of Allâh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n(This letter is) from Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine\nPeace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islâm. Embrace Islâm and you will be saved (from Allâh’s punishment); embrace Islâm, and Allâh will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom: (Allâh’s Statement): \"O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allâh (Alone) ... bear witness that we are Muslims.\" (3:64). \"When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyân added, \"While coming out, I said to my companions, ‘The matter of Ibn Abu Kabshah* (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al-Asfar (i.e. the Romans) is afraid of him.’ So I continued to believe that Allâh’s Messengerصلى الله عليه وسلم would be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islâm.\" Az-Zuhri said, \"Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantine and had them assembled in his house and said, ‘O group of Byzantine! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?’ (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, ‘Bring them back to me.’ So he called them and said, ‘I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.’ Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri Vol.6, Hadîth No.75).\n* Abu Kabshah was not the father of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم but it was a mockery done by Abu Sufyân out of hostility against the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.",

Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said (to his companions): \"Jibrael (Gabriel) عليه السلام came to teach you your religion.\" So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم regarded all that as a religion. And all that which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained to the delegation of ‘Abdûl-Qais was a part of faith. (See Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.50 and 87) And the Statement of Allâhعز وجل : \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him.\" (3:85).\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : One day while the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Jibrael (Gabriel) عليه السلام came and asked, \"What is Faith?\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"Faith is to believe in Allâh, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His messengers, and to believe in Resurrection.\"* Then he further asked, \"What is Islâm?\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"To worship Allâh Alone and none else, to perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât), to give the Zakât and to observe Saum (fasts) during the month of Ramadân,\"** then he further asked, \"What is Ihsân (perfection)?\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"To worship Allâh عز وجل as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.\" Then he further asked, \"When will the Hour be established?\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents:\n(1) When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.\n(2) When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of the five things which nobody knows except Allâh.\nThe Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then recited: \"Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allâh (Alone).\" (31:34). Then that man (Gabriel عليه السلام) left and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked his Companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"That was (angel) Gabriel عليه السلام who came to teach the people their religion.\"\nAbu ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه said: He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) considered all that as a part of faith. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.47).\n*In this Hadîth, only 4 articles are mentioned, while in another Hadîth, 6 articles are mentioned: (i) Allâh, (ii) His Angels, (iii) His Books (The Torah, The Gospel, The Qur’ân and all the other Holy Books revealed by Allâh), (iv) His Messengers, (v) Day of Resurrection and (vi) Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainments), i.e. whatever Allâh has ordained, must come to pass.\n**Again the principles of Islâm mentioned here are 4, but in other narrations, they are 5 - 5th is the pilgrimage (Haji ) to Makkah for the one who can afford it once in a lifetime.",

Some of them said, \"He is sleeping.\" Others said, His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.\" Then they said, \"There is an example for this companion of yours.\" One of them said, \"Then set forth an example for him.\" Some of them said, \"He is sleeping.\" The others said, \"His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.\" Then they said, \"His example is that of a man who has built a house and then, offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whosoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet.\" Then the angels said, \"Interpret this parable to him so that he may understand it.\" Some of them said, \"He is sleeping.\" The others said, \"His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.\" And then they said, \"The house stands for Paradise and the call-maker is Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and whoever obeys Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , obeys Allâh; and whoever disobeys Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, disobeys Allâh. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.385).\nD) Narrated Abu Mûsa رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"My example, and the example of what I have been sent with, is that of a man who came to some people and said, ‘O people I have seen the enemy’s army with my own eyes, and I am the naked warner; so protect yourselves!’ Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at night proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely.
