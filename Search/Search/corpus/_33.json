When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled. Mûsâ (Moses) picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, ‘O stone! give me my clothes!’ till he reached a group of Banî Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Allah had created; and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Mûsâ (Moses) took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the hitting: three, four or five marks. This was what Allah عز وجل refers to in His Saying:\n‘O you who believe! Be not like those, who annoyed Mûsâ (Moses), but Allâh cleared him of that which they alleged and he was honourable before Allâh...’ \" (V.33:69) (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadîth No. 616).",
