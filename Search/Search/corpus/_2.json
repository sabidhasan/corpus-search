He will say, ‘Go to Nûh (Noah), for he was the first Messenger Allâh sent to the inhabitants of the earth.’ They will go to him and Nûh (Noah) will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking.’ He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do something of which he had no knowledge, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, ‘Go to Khalil-ur-Rahmân. * [i.e. Ibrâhîm (Abraham)]. They will go to him and will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Mûsâ (Moses), the slave to whom Allâh spoke (directly) and gave him the Taurât (Torah).’ So they will go to him and he will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking,’ and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, ‘Go to ‘Îsâ (Jesus), Allâh’s slave, His Messenger and Allâh’s Word and a spirit coming from Him. ** ‘Îsâ (Jesus) will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the slave of Allâh whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allâh.’ So they will come to me and I will proceed till I ask my Lord’s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed. ‘(Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will raise my head and praise Allâh with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allâh, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allâh will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom I will admit into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and He will say, ‘None remains in Hell but those whom the Qur’ân has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.’\" (The compiler) Abu ‘Abdullâh said; ‘But those whom the Qur’ân has imprisoned in Hell’ refers to the statement of Allâh عز وجل: \"To abide therein ...

But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. They learn what harmed them and did not benefit them, although they already knew that whoever gets into it would not have any share in the Hereafter. How terrible was the price for which they sold themselves, if only they knew!"

A meal was presented to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid) who said, \"I do not eat anything which you slaughter on your Nusub * in the name of your idols, etc. I eat only those (animals meat) on which Allâh’s Name has been mentioned at the time of (their) slaughtering.\" Zaid bin ‘Amr used to criticise the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals and used to say, \"Allâh has created the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in others than the Name of Allâh.\" He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as something abominable.\nNarrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما: Zaid bin ‘Amr bin Nufail went to Shâm (the region comprising Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan), enquiring about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, \"I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it\". The Jew said, \"You will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allâh’s Anger. Zaid said, I do not run except from Allâh’s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion? He said, \"I do not know any other religion except Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism).\" Zaid enquired, \"What is Hanîf?\" He said, \"Hanîf is the religion of (the Prophet) Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام, he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship none but Allâh (Alone) - Islâmic Monotheism.\" Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious scholar and told him the same (as before). The Christian said, \"You will not embrace our religion unless you get a share of Allâh’s Curse.\" Zaid replied, \"I do not run except from Allâh’s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allâh’s Curse and His Anger if I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?\" He replied, \"I do not know any other religion except Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism).\" Zaid enquired, \"What is Hanîf ?\" He replied \"Hanîf is the religion of (the Prophet) Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام, he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship none but Allâh (Alone) - Islâmic Monotheism.\" When Zaid heard their statement about (the religion of) Ibrâhîm (Abraham), he left that place, and when he came out, he raised both his hands and said, \"O Allâh! I make You my Witness that I am on the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham)\".\nNarrated Asmâ bint Abu Bakr رضي الله عنها: I saw Zaid bin ‘Amr bin Nufail standing with his back against the Ka‘bah and saying, \"O people of Quraish! By Allâh, none amongst you is on the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) except me.\" She added: He (Zaid) used to preserve the lives of little girls: if somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him, \"Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf\". So he would take her, and when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, ‘Now if you will (wish), I will give her to you, and if you will (wish), I will feed her on your behalf.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.5, Hadîth No.169).\n* Nusub: See the glossary.",

The bedouin then said, \"By Him Who has honoured you, I will neither perform any Nawâfil nor will I decrease what Allâh has enjoined on me.\" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"If he is saying the truth, he will succeed (or he will be granted Paradise).

So, the person observing Saum (fasting) should avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody fights with him or abuses him, he should say to him twice, ‘I am fasting.’ \" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better with Allâh تعالى than the smell of musk. (Allâh says about the fasting person), ‘He has left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The Saum (fast) is for Me**. So I will reward (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times.’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Hadîth No.118, Vol.3).\n* See Fath Al-Barî , Vol.5, Page 5.\n** Although all practices of worshipping are for Allâh, here Allâh تعالى singles out Saum (fasting), because fasting cannot be practiced for the sake of showing-off, as nobody except Allâh can know whether one is fasting or not. Therefore, fasting is a pure performance that cannot be blemished with hypocrisy. (Fath Al-Barî, Vol.5, Page 10)\n(C) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Whoever does not give up lying speech - false statements (i.e. telling lies) and acting on those (lies), and evil actions etc., then Allâh is not in need of his leaving his food and drink (i.e. Allâh will not accept his fasting*)\".

Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"My similitude in comparison with the other Prophets before me is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people go round about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: ‘Would that this brick be put in its place!’ So I am that brick, and I am the last (end) of the Prophets.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.735).\nC. Narrated Ibn Mas‘ûd رضي الله عنه: As if I saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم talking about one of the Prophets whose nation had beaten him and caused him to bleed, while he was cleaning the blood off his face and saying, \"O Allâh! Forgive my nation, for they have no knowledge.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.683).\nD. Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها and Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: On his death-bed, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم put a sheet over his face and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and removing the sheet) he said, \"May Allâh’s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for they built places of worship at the graves of their Prophets.\" (By that) he intended to warn (the Muslims) from what they (i.e., Jews and Christians) had done. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.660).\nE. Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"The Isrâelis used to be ruled and guided by Prophets. Whenever a Prophet died, another would take over his place. There will be no Prophet after me, but there will be caliphs who will increase in number.\" The people asked, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! What do you order us (to do)?\" He said, \"Obey the one who will be given the Bai‘a - pledge first.* Fulfil their (i.e. the caliphs’) rights, for Allâh will ask them about (any shortcomings in) ruling those whom Allâh has put under their guardianship.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No. 661).\n* If the Bai‘a (pledge) is given to a caliph and after a while another caliph is given the Bai‘a (pledge) by some members of the society, the common Muslims should abide by the Bai‘a (pledge) given to the first caliph, for the election of the second is invalid.",

            "english_hilali_khan": " (2:279)\na) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: Once Bilâl brought Bami (a kind of) dates to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked him, \"From where have you brought these?\" Bilâl replied, \"I had some inferior kind of dates and exchanged two Sâ‘ of it for one Sâ‘ of Bami dates, in order to give it to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم to eat.\" Thereupon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Beware! Beware! This is definitely Ribâ (usury)! This is definitely Ribâ (usury)! Don’t do so, but if you want to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior kind of dates for money and then, buy the superior kind of dates with that money.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Hadîth No.506).\nb) Narrated Samura bin Jundub رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم very often used to ask his companions, \"Did anyone of you see a dream?\" So, dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allâh willed to relate. One morning the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Last night two persons (angels) came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’ I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, smashing it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to its normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allâh! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’ So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position, and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other (second) side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the first side. He hardly completed that (second) side when the first side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allâh! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’ So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I think the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"In that oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’ And so we proceeded and came across a river.\" I think he said, \"- red like blood.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these two persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Ascend up’ and I ascended up.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they became in the best shape.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم further added, \"My two companions (angels) said to me: ‘This place is the ‘Adn Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me: ‘That (palace) is your place’ I said to them: ‘May Allâh bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).’ I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’ They replied, ‘We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur’ân, and then neither recites it, nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers-fornicators and the adulteresses-fornicatresses, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river, and was given a stone to swallow, is the eater of Ribâ (usury), and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going around it, is Mâlik; the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Ibrâhîm (Abraham), and the children around him are those who die on Al-Fitrah (the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism).’ \" The narrator added : Some Muslims asked the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم Allâh’s Messenger! What about the children of Al-Mushrikûn?*\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"And also the children of Al-Mushrikûn.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, \"My two companions added, ‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was evil, but Allâh forgave them.’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 9, Hadîth No. 171).\n* Al-Mushrikûn: polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم.",
