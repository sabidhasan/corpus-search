Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم distributed that amongst four persons: ‘Uyainah bin Badr, Aqra‘ bin Hâbis, Zaid Al-Khail and the fourth was either ‘Alqamah or ‘Âmir bin At-Tufail.

Be afraid of Allâh.\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Woe to you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear Allâh?\" Then that man went away. Khâlid bin Al-Walîd said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger!
